# 🐶 AI Dog Breed Recognition

## 📌 Overview
The **AI Dog Breed Recognition** project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to identify dog breeds from images.  
It uses **transfer learning** with the **VGG16** architecture, fine-tuned to recognize multiple dog breeds with high accuracy.

This project is implemented in Python using **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on a labeled dataset of dog images organized by breed.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automatic Breed Classification**: Classifies images into one of several predefined dog breeds.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes VGG16 pre-trained weights for efficient and accurate training.
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves model generalization using image preprocessing.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Can be adapted to recognize other breeds or animal categories.
- **Train / Validation / Test Split**: Ensures robust model evaluation.
